# Hengill Seismicity Forecasting Models
This repository has been developed in the framework of the COSEISMIQ project (http://www.coseismiq.ethz.ch/en/home/) and comprises the models and data for running pseudo-forecasting model (see Deliverable 6 of COSEIMSIQ). The codes proposed here can be extended and applied in real-time provided the hydraulic/seismic data are updated accordingly.

with model blocks in yellow, static data in green, analysis scripts in red and model outputs in purple.

## Data
### Seismic data
The seismic catalogue can be acquired openly through FDSN servers: http://www.coseismiq.ethz.ch/en/dissemination/catalogs/. The data provided runs from Dec. 2018 to Aug. 2021.
We use the medium quality catalogue (SED_auto_MQ, event score >-5, within the Hengill regional limits).
A statistical analysis of the whole dataset shows that the overall magnitude of completeness (Mc) is 0.3, with a b-value of 0.93. For all models, we assume the Mc=0.3 and filter the catalogue above this magnitude.

Supporting information for the catalogues, seismic data acquisition and processing can be found in Grigoli et al., 2021 (submitted).

### Hydraulic data
Injection and production rates obtained from Reykjavik Energy are distributed in a symmetrical bivariate Gaussian distribution around the well-head to account for fluid migration in the subsurface with daily granularity.
The rates, volumes and cumulative volumes (and their associated times) are provided as is. In the future a automated script to create the distribution will be made available as well as the raw hydraulic data once they are public.

## Models

Two families of model are implemented: a Seismogenic Index type and a class of ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) models. 
Details can be found for each model in their respective folder's README

### Seismogenic Index Model
Based on Mignan et al., 2016; Shapiro, 2018; Broccardo et al., 2020.
This model is implemented without a shut-in phase, with cumulative volumes spatially distributed and productivity `a_{fbi}` and the Gutenberg-Richter b-value estimated by minimizing the residuals with a maximum likelihood optimisation function (modified from Broccardo et al., 2017).

### ETAS type models
Three version of ETAS are implemented:
- the null hypothesis `ETAS_{0}` 
- an Advanced ETAS model with spatially varying background rate
- a prototype of ETAS with hydraulic coupling based on injection and production rate

## Learning and forecasting periods
We take as a base Learning Period (LP) all the data recorded from Dec. 1st 2018 up to Feb. 1st, 2020. Using this data, we calibrate all the competing models. Then we perform a daily forecast and update the LP with the additional information. We do this process of training and forecasting repeatedly until the end of the dataset on Feb. 1st 2021.

## Model comparison and evaluation scheme
### Visualisation
From each model's output, maps of the forecasted seismicity rates and log likelihood, temporal evolution of the forecasted number of events and temporal evolution of the log likelihood of the forecast can be computed with the VisualisationModels.m script.
### Models comparison and evaluation
For each model, the N-test (as defined by the CSEP: https://cseptesting.org/) for each forecast in computed.
Using ETAS0 as the null hypothesis, ComparisonModels.m computes the "Cumulative Information Gain" of the models relative to this null hypothesis.
