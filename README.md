## Data
### Seismic data

### Hydraulic data

## Models

Two families of model are implemented: a Seismogenic Index type and a class of ETAS (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) models. 
Details can be found for each model in their respective folder's README
### Seismogenic Index Model
Based on Mignan et al., 2016; Shapiro, 2018; Broccardo et al., 2020.
This model is implemented without a shut-in phase, with cumulative volumes spatially distributed and productivity `a_{fbi}` and the Gutenberg-Richter b-value estimated by minimizing the residuals with a maximum likelihood optimisation function (modified from Broccardo et al., 2017).

### ETAS type models
Three version of ETAS are implemented:
- the null hypothesis `ETAS_{0}` 
- an Advanced ETAS model with spatially varying background rate
- a prototype of ETAS with hydraulic coupling based on injection and production rate
