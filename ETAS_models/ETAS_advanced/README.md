## Advanced ETAS model

The advanced ETAS is a variant of ETAS model which features spatially variable background rate. All other aspects of advanced ETAS are like ETAS0. However, even though the background rate is spatially heterogeneous, the model still assumes that it is invariant in time.

### How to
Use codes provided in folder ETAS_0 and set parameter KDE_BKG to 1 to enable spatial variation of the background rate.
